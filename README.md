This is the companion repo to my undergraduate thesis "A Quantum Optics Lab Using Photon Pairs". It contains all code which we used to perform the lab during my Summer 2018 REU at SUNY Geneseo.

Specifically, it contains data analysis in jupyter notebooks, VHDL code to run on the Altegra Board, and relevant Labview Programs which we used.

Note: I am not the sole author of much of this code.
