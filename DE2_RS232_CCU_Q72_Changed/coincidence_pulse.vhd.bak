ARCHITECTURE circuit OF coincidence_pulse IS
BEGIN
-- The output y will give a pulse for each coincidence of four simultaneos photons
-- The variables e through h represent the switches SW(5) to SW(2) on the DE2 Board
-- If on of these switches is on then the signal from the corresponing photon detector is ignored
	y <= (a or NOT e) and (b or NOT f) and (c or NOT g) and (d or NOT h);
